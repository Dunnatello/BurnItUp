# Burn it Up!
## Team Shark Bait

### Project Objective
Our goal for this university course project was to design a weight loss app for Android devices using Lua and Solar2D (formerly Corona SDK). This involved architecture and design, code review, and unit testing.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1:</b> When the application is opened for the first time, users will be prompted with a welcome screen.</p>

Our main objective was to develop a weight loss app that could track calories, weight, and exercise based on user provided information. This application was designed to assist users in the weight loss process.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2:</b> Users will be prompted to input some initial data for weight loss goal tracking. This data is stored locally.</p>

## Burn it Up!
The application, <i>Burn it Up!</i>, features a Material Design 1.0 interface with several menus for users to navigate through to track their weight loss progress. We designed the menus to be modular so that more features could be added trivially.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 3:</b> The day overview allows the user to view a day's tracked calories/exercises and track progress as needed.</p>

## Conclusions And Lessons Learned
This project taught us how to work on software development collaboratively and use version control software such as GitHub. We also learned how to calculate calories burned from various workouts based on MET data. Furthermore, we learned how to distribute tasks in order to meet our deadlines.<br><br>Originally, we intended to include a large dataset of food items from a public database, but the file size for the dataset exceeded 100 MB, so we only included a few items for testing. Additional food data can be included to add more user options or an online database could be connected to the application with some additional work.

### Final Words
After completing this project, we gained knowledge on how to use GitHub version control and learned the processes of software development collaboration. Additionally, we completed development on the application by achieving all of the goals that we planned.
